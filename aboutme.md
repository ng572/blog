I've got a strong interest in Linux ever since I started learning ML/DL on an Ubuntu. Linux is fast, customizable, and gives you a lot of control. Do you know you can craete backward-compatible images of programs on Linux? [Foxit](https://www.foxit.com/), for example, stopped development since 16.04, but with a little magic with docker and xhost, you can run it on any new Linux distributions.

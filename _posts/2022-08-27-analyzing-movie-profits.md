I have done some visualization and analysis on the TidyTuesday's dataset `Horror Movies and Profit`, let's see what we can learn from it.

### The history of Movie Profits

First, let's take a look at the return on investment (markup = revenue / cost) of movies thorughout the decades.

There appears to have been a massive earning opportunity at the beginning, where films could make nearly a hundred fold its production cost from tickets.

As more and more films got into the market, the average return dropped. This could be hypothesized as a higher number of firms in the market created a more competitive market outcome

It should be noted that during the 1950-70, the markup went up despite more number of films being produced. This could possibly be due to the introduction of an international audience, and America having temporory monopoly of film production. Or there could be a significant improvement in production efficiency and/or technology.

However, looking at the share of domestic box office, we notice that international box office did not gain prominence during the 1950-70.

Therefore, it is more likely that production efficiency has gone up during this period.
